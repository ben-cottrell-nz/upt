# Introduction
Universal Platform Toolkit: A toolkit for making user interfaces
using platform calls.

## Aims
- Support for these systems:
  - GNU/Linux with GTK+-3.0
  - Microsoft Windows 10
  - Apple macOS 
- Ability to build, as close as possible, similar looking and functioning 
user interfaces across platforms, even at the cost of platform specific features.
- Ease of use, with modern C++11 (and up) features.


## Assumptions
- Each platform supports parenting and creation of controls
and windows with a pointer or value.
